## **Comparison of CAPM Implementation: R (Quarto) vs Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

This document summarizes key improvements made in the R-based Quarto implementation of the CAPM analysis compared to the original Python-based Jupyter Notebook version. While both environments are capable of performing the same financial computations, several practical and presentation-focused enhancements were noted in the R version:

## **Clear Explanations for Each Stage**

**Improvement:**

Each analysis step in the Quarto document includes a clear explanation of what is being done, why it is relevant to CAPM, and how it connects to the broader objective.

**Python Limitation:**

The Jupyter Notebook mostly presents code and output without accompanying narrative, leaving interpretation to the reader.

## **Interpretation of Results**

**Improvement:** Key statistics such as beta, alpha, R-squared, and CAPM expected returns are accompanied by interpretations that explain their significance in financial terms.

**Python Limitation:** Numerical outputs are presented without contextual explanations or financial insights.

## **Structured Workflow**

**Improvement:** The R version is structured into clearly defined stages (e.g., Stage 1 to Stage 9), providing a logical, easy-to-follow workflow.

**Python Limitation:** The analysis in Python is fragmented with no consistent organization, making the analytical flow harder to follow.

## **Enhanced Readability and Presentation**

**Improvement:** R code is modular and visually clean, with consistently labeled plots and summaries that enhance readability.

**Python Limitation:** Visual outputs are not consistently formatted or labeled for interpretability.

## **Portfolio-Level Analysis Added**

**Improvement:** The Quarto document calculates portfolio-level expected returns using CAPM, adding practical relevance for investors.

**Python Limitation:** The Jupyter Notebook focuses solely on individual stock analysis without aggregating results for a portfolio.

## **Model Validation and Statistical Diagnostics**

**Improvement:** The final stage in the R implementation includes comprehensive validation metrics for all stock models, including t-values, p-values, and R-squared values.

**Python Limitation:** Diagnostic metrics are limited or absent, offering no assessment of model fit or reliability.
