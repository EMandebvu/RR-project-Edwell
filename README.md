## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

### Objective

Reproduce a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) implementation from Python to R, analyzing reproducibility challenges in financial econometrics.

### Source Project

Original Kaggle Notebook by **Gaurav Dutt**

### Technical Stack

| Component       | Python             | R           |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Data Cleaning  | `pandas`           | `tidyverse` |
| Modeling       | `statsmodels.OLS`  | `lm()`      |
| Visualization  | `seaborn`          | `ggplot2`   |

### Reproducibility Validation

To ensure the reproducibility of our CAPM implementation, please follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - For Python, install required packages with:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```  
   - For R, install necessary packages (if not already installed) with:  
     ```r
     install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "ggplot2"))
     ```  
   - Using consistent package versions is important to avoid discrepancies.

2. **Data Consistency**  
   - Use the provided cleaned dataset `data/cleaned_returns.csv` to reproduce results exactly.  
   - Do not modify raw data unless changes are documented.

3. **Run the Code**  
   - First, execute the Python scripts/notebooks in `code/original_python/` to reproduce the original CAPM results.  
   - Then run the R scripts in `code/rewritten_r/` for the translated analysis.

4. **Output Comparison**  
   - Compare outputs such as regression coefficients (betas and alphas), summary statistics, and visualizations saved in the `outputs/` folder.  
   - Results between Python and R implementations should be closely aligned, demonstrating reproducibility.

5. **Reporting Issues**  
   - If any discrepancies occur, please document and report them by opening an issue in this repository for efficient troubleshooting.

## ðŸ“š Additional Notes

- The Python code uses `pandas` for data handling, `statsmodels` for regression, and `seaborn` for plotting.  
- The R version leverages `tidyverse` for data wrangling, `lm()` for regression modeling, and `ggplot2` for visualization.  
- Both implementations aim to deliver equivalent CAPM analysis results and insights.  
- The cleaned dataset includes daily returns prepared for regression, ensuring comparability.
