### **Project Overview**

#### Objective

Reproduce a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) implementation from Python to R, analyzing reproducibility challenges in financial econometrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Key Components

-   Data cleaning and preprocessing
-   CAPM regression modeling
-   Portfolio return calculations
-   Statistical validation

#### Technical Stack

| Component     | Python            | R           |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Data Cleaning | `pandas`          | `tidyverse` |
| Modeling      | `statsmodels.OLS` | `lm()`      |
| Visualization | `seaborn`         | `ggplot2`   |

#### Reproducibility Validation

To ensure the reproducibility of our CAPM implementation, please follow these steps:

1.  **Environment Setup**
    -   For Python, install required packages with:

        ``` bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    -   For R, install necessary packages (if not already installed) with:

        ``` r
        install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "ggplot2"))
        ```

    -   Using consistent package versions is important to avoid discrepancies.
2.  **Data Consistency**
    -   Use the provided cleaned dataset `data/cleaned_returns.csv` to reproduce results exactly.
    -   Do not modify raw data unless changes are documented.
3.  **Run the Code**
    -   First, execute the Python scripts/notebooks in `code/original_python/` to reproduce the original CAPM results.
    -   Then run the R scripts in `code/rewritten_r/` for the translated analysis.
4.  **Output Comparison**
    -   Compare outputs such as regression coefficients (betas and alphas), summary statistics, and visualizations saved in the `outputs/` folder.
    -   Results between Python and R implementations should be closely aligned, demonstrating reproducibility.
5.  **Reporting Issues**
    -   If any discrepancies occur, please document and report them by opening an issue in this repository for efficient troubleshooting.

#### Software Versions Used
R (CRAN): 4.5.0 (2025-04-11), "How About a Twenty-Six"

RStudio: 2025.05.1+513 (Released 2025-06-05)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Additional Notes

-   The Python code uses `pandas` for data handling, `statsmodels` for regression, and `seaborn` for plotting.
-   The R version leverages `tidyverse` for data wrangling, `lm()` for regression modeling, and `ggplot2` for visualization.
-   Both implementations aim to deliver equivalent CAPM analysis results and insights.
-   The cleaned dataset includes daily returns prepared for regression, ensuring comparability.
-   For comparison of results, refer to the QMD presentation (CAPM presentation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Observations

Both implementations produced consistent alpha and beta estimates with slight rounding differences, confirming the accuracy of the translation.

R's ggplot2 provided more flexible and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

Python’s pandas felt slightly more intuitive for initial data manipulation, but R's dplyr offered strong alternatives.

Model diagnostics were easier in R using built-in summary functions and broom package.
